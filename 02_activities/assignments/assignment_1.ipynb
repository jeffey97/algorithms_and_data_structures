    "Explanation of the Code:-\n",
    "\n",
    "\"dfs” Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The “dfs” (depth first search) function is a recursive helper that finds all root to leaf paths in the binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To explore every path from the root node down to each leaf node and collect these paths.\n",
    "\n",
    " How It Works:\n",
    "  1. Visit Current Node: When the function reaches a node, it appends the node”s value to the “current_path” list.\n",
    "  2. Check for Leaf Node: It checks if the current node is a leaf (no left or right children). \n",
    "     a. If it’s a leaf: A complete path has been found. The function makes a copy of “current_path” and adds it to the “paths” list.\n",
    "     b. If not a leaf: It continues the search by recursively calling itself on the left and right children.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. Backtracking: After exploring both children, the function removes the current node”s value from “current_path” before returning to the previous call. Backtracking is necessary because it ensures that “current_path” remains accurate for other paths. Without backtracking, “current_path” would accumulate values from different paths, leading to incorrect results.\n",
    "\n",
    "“build_tree” Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The “build_tree” function constructs the binary tree from a list of values provided in level order (breadth first) format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: To convert a list like [1, 2, 3, None, 4] into an actual binary tree structure.\n",
    "\n",
    " How It Works:\n",
    "  1. Initialization: It starts by creating the root node from the first element of the list.\n",
    "  2. Using a Queue: It uses a queue to keep track of nodes whose children need to be assigned.\n",
    "  3. Assigning Children: It iterates through the list, assigning left and right children to each node in the queue.\n",
    "  4. Handling “None” Values: “None” in the list represents an absent child,so the function skips creating a node for it.\n",
    "  5. Building the Tree: This process continues until all nodes are processed, resulting in the complete binary tree.\n",
    "\n",
    " Edge Cases:\n",
    "  1. Empty Tree: If the input “root” is “None”, meaning the tree is empty, the “bt_path” function returns an empty list “[]” since there are no paths to record.\n",
    "  2. Single Node Tree: If the tree consists of only the root node, the function returns a list containing a single path with that node”s value, e.g., “[[root.val]]”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "By carefully adding and removing node values in “current_path”, the “dfs” function effectively tracks each unique path from the root to every leaf. The “build_tree” function allows us to easily create a binary tree from a list, handling various scenarios like missing children. Together, these functions enable us to find all root to leaf paths in a binary tree in an efficient and organized manner.\n",
